Hi, I'm **Ayush**. 👋

I am a researcher and engineer based in Bangalore, driven by the goal of making Artificial Intelligence more reliable, transparent, and safe for the real world.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at **LG Ad Solutions**, where I build and optimize large-scale inference systems. Before joining the industry, I graduated from the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi**  with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

### 🔭 Research & Philosophy
My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **AI Safety**, and **Neuro-symbolic AI**. I am particularly focused on the "fragility" of modern deep learning—specifically how models that perform well on average often fail in critical, low-probability "tail" scenarios.

My goal is to move beyond "black box" architectures to build systems that are **"safe-by-design"**. This involves exploring methods like curriculum learning and temporal logic to ensure models behave consistently, even under environmental shifts or adversarial conditions.

Recently, my work on reducing bias in spatio-temporal scene graph generation, **"ImparTail,"** was accepted as a **Highlight Paper (top 10% of accepted papers)** at **CVPR 2025**.

### 🧩 Outside of Work
When I’m not debugging code or reading papers, I try to step away from the screen. I enjoy **sightseeing** and exploring new cities. I’m also quite competitive when it comes to sports—you can usually find me unwinding with a serious game of **pool** or **table tennis**.
